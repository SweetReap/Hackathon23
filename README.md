# GRAFFITI N' NYC | Hackathon '23
## A map that shows users where to find art in NYC.

A cute web app that was created in a short 5 hour hackathon[^1] that uses **Google Maps API** and the **NYC Open Data API** to show art galleries within New York City. They can be searched by name, and further filtered by zipcode and price[^2].

[^1]: This site was later edited and improved on after the 2023 Spring Hackathon.
[^2]: More filters will be added in future publications.
